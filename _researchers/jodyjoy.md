Jody Joy (BA, MA, PhD, FSA) is curator with responsibility for British and European Archaeology.

He specializes in the archaeology of northwest Europe during the first millennium BC but his research interests also include the later Bronze Age and early Roman periods.

His main interests concern art and technology and he is currently involved in research projects examining: the technology of Iron Age cauldrons and their role as feasting vessels; Iron Age torcs and their relationship with the human body; and the role of so-called Celtic art in Iron Age society. He is also interested in human remains, particularly exploring issues surrounding display and storage in museums.

He has previously worked at the British Museum, where he was Curator of European Iron Age Collections for eight years.

He has also given lectures on subjects as diverse as European Prehistory, Museum Studies and Archaeological Theory to students at the University of Southampton.
