Dr Paola Ricciardi is the Fitzwilliam Museum's Research Scientist. She is responsible for the scientific aspects of the MINIARE research project, which uses a cross-disciplinary approach to study medieval and Renaissance illuminated manuscripts. She is also engaged in research on other types of objects such as medieval polychrome wood sculptures, early Modern portrait miniatures, and 18th century ceramics and glass. Paola has co-authored over 30 refereed papers and book chapters, and recently finished co-editing the two-volume proceedings of the ‘Manuscripts in the Making: Art and Science’ conference (Cambridge, 2016). She has lectured widely at scholarly conferences and study days, and given numerous public talks for general audiences in Cambridge. She holds a PhD in Cultural Heritage Science from the University of Florence (2008) and a Master’s Degree in Physics from the University of Rome (2003). Before joining the Fitzwilliam Museum in October 2011, she spent three years at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC as the Samuel H. Kress post-doctoral Fellow in Imaging Science. She is a member of ICOM (International Council of Museums), ICON (The Institute of Conservation) and AIAr (Italian Association for Archaeometry), and regularly acts as reviewer for several scientific publications.
