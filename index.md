The University of Cambridge holds exceptional museums and collections
reflecting Cambridge's position as one of the world's leading universities

As research intensive organisations, the museums and Botanic Garden have
presented research and collaborative outcomes through 40 temporary
exhibitions, engaging over 1,300,000 visitors.

We've hosted over 7,700 research visits in the past year, with researchers visiting us from nearly 400 institutions and looking at well over 25,000 objects, ensuring our collections are embedded into research outputs worldwide. We've also supported over 14,500 students and loaned 1,300 objects to 156 different institutions

The University collections form a research infrastructure that is unique to the
Cambridge research environment. In the following pages you can find out
more about each institution and research case studies, as well as the
under-researched areas of the collections that would provide the ideal Focus
for new collaborative projects.
