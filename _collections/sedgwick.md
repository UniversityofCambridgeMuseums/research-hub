## The Sedgwick Museum's collections range across all aspects of the Earth Sciences, with substantial scientific and cultural value, and active acquisition through research.  

#### Woodwardian Collection
The Museum is founded on the collection of Dr John Woodward (1665-1728), comprising almost 10,000 rocks, fossils, minerals, archaeological and ethnographic artefacts. It includes specimens obtained from early members of the Royal Society including Sir Isaac Newton and Sir Christopher Wren.  The collection is international in scope, including specimens obtained from the explorer William Dampier. Many specimens have been figured in early treatises concerning theories on the origin of fossils including specimens figured as early as 1670 by the artist and naturalist Agostino Scilla. 

#### Archive 
The archive comprises 1500 boxes of records including field notebooks, sketchbooks and specimen catalogues of Adam Sedgwick himself, as well as other geologists, palaeontologists and mineralogists with an association to the Museum’s collections or to the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge. It also includes papers charting the history and development of the Museum, and Sedgwick Club, started in 1880 in memory of Adam Sedgwick.

#### Palaeontology Collection 
Comprising more than 1 million individual specimens, it is taxonomically comprehensive and international in scope. The collection includes a large number of type (over 9,000 primary types), figured and cited specimens (over 16,000 each) and other scientifically and historically important material. 

#### Mineral Collection  
The collection comprises 40,000 – 55,000 specimens about half of which were acquired from four major collectors: A. Hume (1841), H. Brooke (1857), J. Carne (1899) and T. Wiltshire (1897). The collection is notable for its holdings of sulphides and sulphosalts from the Binntal in Switzerland, and for its meteorites. 

#### Petrology Collection  
The Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology Collection has global coverage; most major igneous and metamorphic provinces are represented. It consists of about 160,000 hand specimens and 250,000 thin sections, about 25% of which have been referenced in the international scientific literature. The Sedimentary Petrology Collection, comprises about 32,000 hand specimens and an unknown number of thin sections. It includes specimens collected by J. S. Henslow, A. Sedgwick, and R.H. Rastall. The collection includes the Cambridge bore core made by W.B.R. King c. 1951. The ‘Sedgwick Museum Stratigraphy Collection’ of thin sections (about 3,500 specimens) has been produced from this collection.

#### Building Stone Collection  
The John Watson Building Stone Collection comprises approximately 2,500 specimens of building stones, roofing slates, road stones, flagstones and decorative and ornamental stones that were in extensive use throughout Britain and the world during the 19th and early 20th centuries.

### Collection Status

## Research Interests

## Potential areas for research

We welcome research collaborations on all aspects of our collections, and direct interested earth science researchers to the researcher biographies on the [Department of Earth Sciences website](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/research).     

We are keen to develop research projects that link our archives with our collections, for example around Adam Sedgwick’s field collections, field notebooks and publications
 
We are also very keen to collaborate with researchers who can help us better understand the cultural and historic aspects of our collections, in particular hidden, contested or challenging histories, for example the early history of women geologists,  ‘The Foreign and Colonial Building Stone Collection’ and the Iguanodon donated by King Leopold II of Belgium.

## Context and Capacity

### Related academic departments

The Museum is embedded in the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge.

### Staffing

The Museum has 12 full-time staff. 

### Planning Timeframe

The Museum plans research exhibitions a year ahead, but is able to respond to smaller display and engagement opportunities on a much shorter timescale.
