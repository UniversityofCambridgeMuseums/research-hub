<h2>Cambridge University Herbarium holds an estimated 1.1 million dried pressed plant specimens, representing over 300 years of species discovery, expeditions, and research all over the world.</h2>

The Herbarium is especially rich in ‘type’ specimens – the original specimens used to describe new species (numbering an estimated 50,000 individual specimens), specimens of historic importance, and British plants.

Particularly notable collections from the 19th century include the collections of notable individuals such as John Stevens Henslow, Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, Nathaniel Wallich, John Lindley, David Douglas, and Richard Spruce. 

The fourth largest collection in the UK, the Cambridge University Herbarium is a rich resource for many scientific and historical fields of research, from evolutionary genetic studies to present day conservation science and investigations into colonial history and development of scientific ideas about the natural world. The Herbarium has an associated and important botanical library and collections of botanical illustrations and artwork, photographs, photographic slides, and microscope slides.  

Key items (collections) include:

* An estimated 50,000 nomenclatural type specimens – the original plant specimens taxonomic plant names are attached to in perpetuity
* Nearly 1,000 specimens collected by Charles Darwin on the Voyage of the Beagle (1831-35) and in the UK
* Approximately 3,000 specimens dating from the early to mid-18th century from the herbarium of Cambridge’s second professor of botany, John Martyn (1699-1768).
* c.58,000 specimens comprising the herbarium of John Lindley, the secretary of the Horticultural Society of London (later the Royal Horticultural Society), including many type specimens of important and charismatic ornamental plants grown in gardens today 
* c.17,000 specimens collected by renowned ecologist and fellow and master of Corpus Christi College Oliver Rackham (1939-2015)

### Collection status

Working towards Designation, and then Accreditation.

### Current research projects

### Future priority areas
Future priority areas and areas of potential for research collaboration include (but are very definitely not limited to):
 
* Cambridge Digital Library and Cambridge Digital Humanities
* Darwin Correspondence Project and UL Special Collections 
* Cambridge Conservation Initiative and IUCN

## Context and capacity

### Associated academic departments

The Hebarium is part of the Department of Plant Sciences, within the University's School of Biological Sciences.

### Staffing

1 member of staff

### Planning timeframes

When proposing a collaboration, please give as much time as possible, due to the Herbarium's limited capacity. However, the Herbariumcan be relatively responsive if input needed is limited – or if additional resource is available. For research work, if you need student input, please time your project to the academic terms. For projects to start in Michaelmas term for undergraduates, and Summer Students to be applying for funding in Lent term, a year in advance would be ideal to be able to pitch projects to students at appropriate times in the academic year.
