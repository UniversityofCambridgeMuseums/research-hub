## Founded in 1816, the Fitzwilliam Museum is the lead partner of the University of Cambridge Museums partnership. 

It houses more than 500,000 objects from antiquities to decorative arts, coins and medals, manuscripts and printed books, paintings, drawings and prints, spanning six continents and over 5,000 years of history. 

The Fitzwilliam Museum collections, Designated in their entirety, are among the most important in their categories in Britain and the world, and constitute a vital and much-consulted resource for research in the history of art, archaeology, material and visual culture. The quality of the collections, the specialist knowledge of Museum staff and the unparalleled access provided through our exhibitions, displays, study rooms and library, make the Museum a unique resource for researchers and students from a wide range of disciplines from across the HE and Museum sector. 

The Museum’s mission is to contribute to society through the pursuit of research, education and learning at the highest international levels of excellence, by preserving and extending our world-class collections and by offering exhibitions and public programmes to engage as wide an audience as possible. The Museum welcomes over 400,000 visitors per year. 

The [Hamilton Kerr Institute](https://www.hki.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/), a department of the Fitzwilliam Museum, plays a world-leading role in conservation practice, teaching and research into easel paintings. In this environment the Institute aims to educate painting conservators to the highest standard and to contribute to scientific, technical and art historical research. The HKI works with and for numerous collections in the UK, including the National Trust, Royal Collection, Historic England, National Portrait Gallery and Wallace Collection.

### Collection status

The Museum is Accredited and its collections Designated as being of 'pre-eminent and…of national and international importance'.

## Research Strengths

Researchers at the Fitzwilliam and Hamilton Kerr Institute (HKI) study an exceptionally wide range of artworks and objects of material culture, including ancient artefacts, coins, drawings, jewellery, literary texts, manuscripts, paintings, painted surfaces, prints and sculptures that cover a vast time period, from the ancient world to the twenty-first century. In addition to collections-based research, the Museum has particular strengths in practice-led research in learning, digital humanities and conservation. 

Recently, the Fitzwilliam and HKI’s most conspicuous research expertise has included integrating technical art history and heritage science into ‘traditional’ arts and humanities methodologies enabling us to challenge existing understandings of artistic and material practices. Particular interests in this area include medieval objects (painted decoration in UK churches, polychrome wooden sculptures, medieval and Renaissance manuscripts), ancient Egyptian coffins, sixteenth- and seventeenth-century portrait miniatures and our ancient Mediterranean collections. 

Our temporary exhibitions schedule provides opportunities to showcase parts of our collection that are not usually on display and to contextualise them with loans from other collections. 

New strands of research in digital humanities and learning, engagement and impact are responding to national and international economic strategies, especially around supporting the creative economy, and to social imperatives around supporting wellbeing and promoting cultural access for all. Digital humanities research is bringing the latest advances to the Fitzwilliam’s collections and audiences, particularly focused around open data and research, including teaching 3D imaging skills and uploading museum objects onto Sketchfab, an open access portal that allows for creative reuse of museum objects. Through developing the use of crowdsourcing platforms, museum and archival data has been further opened up for research and engagement. 

Another significant area of development has been research examining the value of arts and culture and what difference they make to individuals and communities. Members of the learning team have led several high profile projects investigating the use of collections-based resources in schools and digital making in museums and documenting the experiences of very young children in museums. These strands form standalone projects but also underpin approaches to collections, engagement and interpretation across the Fitzwilliam and HKI. 

## Future research 

The Museum is particularly keen to engage in research collaborations across the University, within the University of Cambridge Museums and beyond around three main areas of interrelated focus: art and our lives, making and technology, art and science.  

The Fitzwilliam is also in the process of developing annual themes. For academic year 2019/20 the theme is Sensual/Virtual, for 2020/21 Truth will be the focus and 2021/22 will look at Islands and Empires. We are keen that activities happening in each academia year have a clear engagement with the relevant theme and will be aiming to release themes 5-10 years ahead to give researchers the opportunity to plan collaborations with the Museum into long-running research projects. 

## Context and capacity 

### Related academic departments

The Museum has particularly close links with the Department of History of Art but also with other arts and humanities departments, including Archaeology, Classics, English, Modern and Medieval Languages and History. We also work with researchers in science-based disciplines including Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics and Engineering. 

### Staffing

150 full time equivalent staff.

### Planning timeframe

As described above, the Museum is planning exhibitions and public programming linked to its annual themes. We are keen to collaborate with researchers at all levels of engagement: from the small-scale – such as lunchtime talks, delivering a session during a museum Late or supporting undergraduate and postgraduate dissertations on the collections or museum practice – to partnering with us on developing and delivering major research-led exhibitions.  

For all project proposals, we’ll ask you to work with relevant colleagues in the Museum to put together a project proposal that will be approved by our Senior Management Team. We plan exhibitions around 3-5 years in advance and all exhibitions are approved by the Museum’s exhibitions committee, which meets around 3-4 times per year.
